Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company who sought to have a secure web application built for them to protect their clients and their financial transactions. They needed to meet all standards of current financial application through encryption and up to date coding best practices. The most common vulnerabilities existing in their application is using out of date security plug ins that need to be patched. This can be dangerous and easily fixable when these vulnerabilities have been identified already and the updates are available. The maven plug in was helpful to identify dependencies in the system that usually presented to be simple remedies. To increase security, I implemented an encryption algorithm using AES 256-bit to ensure the transfer of data is secure and the encryption and decryption process is efficient and fast. I also ensured the security protocols were using the most current version available. As I worked through implementing the encryption algorithm and refactoring the program, I ran the dependency check again to make sure no new issues appeared and could be addressed as they appeared. I believe the most useful skill from this assignment is the analysis of the vulnerabilities and the ability to identify the best method to remedy the security vulnerabilities in software.
